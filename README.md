Instructors Data Mining I : Prof. Dr. Christian Bizer, Alexander Brinkmann, Keti Korini, Ralph Peeters
Instructors Data Mining II: Prof. Dr. Heiko Paulheim, Nicolas Heist

Data Mining I:

The course consists of a lecture together with accompanying practical exercises as well as student team projects. In the exercises the participants will gather initial expertise in applying state of the art data mining tools on realistic data sets. The team projects take place in the last third of the term. Within the projects, students realize more sophisticated data mining projects of personal choice and report about the results of their projects in the form of a written report as well as an oral presentation.

The course provides an introduction to advanced data analysis techniques as a basis for analyzing business data and providing input for decision support systems. The course will cover the following topics:

- The Data Mining Process
- Data Representation and Preprocessing
- Clustering
- Classification
- Regression
- Association Analysis
- Text Mining

Data Mining II:

Building on the Data Mining fundamentals course, this course deepens the theory and practice of advanced data mining topics, such as:

- Data Preprocessing
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection
- Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
- Parameter Tuning
- Ensemble Methods
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Model Validation

The course consists of a lecture together with accompanying practical exercises as well as student team projects. In the exercises the participants will gather initial expertise in applying state of the art data mining tools on realistic data sets.
